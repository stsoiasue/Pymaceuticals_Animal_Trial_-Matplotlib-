## Unit 5 | Assignment - The Power of Plots

## Pymaceuticals Inc

For this assignment I was provided data from an animal study. In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. I analyzed the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

## To do this I created:

* A scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changed over time for each treatment.
* A scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic(cancer spreading) sites changed over time for each treatment.
* A scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
* A bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
